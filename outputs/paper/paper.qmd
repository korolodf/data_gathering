And check out the one from my birthday XD (gross)

# Introduction

You can and should cross-reference sections and sub-sections. For instance, @sec-data and @sec-first-point.

# Data {#sec-data}

Our data is of penguins (@fig-bills).

```{r}
#| label: fig-bills
#| fig-cap: Bills of penguins
#| echo: false

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"),
                    guide = "none") +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~species, ncol = 1) +
  coord_flip()
```

Talk more about it.

Also bills and their average (@fig-billssssss). (You can change the height and width, but don't worry about doing that until you have finished every other aspect of the paper - Quarto will try to make it look nice and the defaults usually work.)

```{r}
#| label: fig-billssssss
#| fig-cap: More bills of penguins
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"),
                    guide = "none") +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~species, ncol = 1) +
  coord_flip()
```

Talk way more about it.

# Model

$$
Pr(\theta | y) = \frac{Pr(y | \theta) Pr(\theta)}{Pr(y)}
$$ {#eq-bayes}

@eq-bayes seems useful, eh?

Here's a dumb example of how to use some references: In paper we run our analysis in `R` [@citeR]. We also use the `tidyverse` which was written by @thereferencecanbewhatever If we were interested in baseball data then @citeLahman could be useful.

We can use maths by including latex between dollar signs, for instance $\theta$.

# Results

# Discussion

## First discussion point {#sec-first-point}

If my paper were 10 pages, then should be be at least 2.5 pages. The discussion is a chance to show off what you know and what you learnt from all this.

## Second discussion point

## Third discussion point

## Weaknesses and next steps

Weaknesses and next steps should also be included.
